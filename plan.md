## 🎯 Core Strategy Questions:

1. Which hackathon category are you targeting?
   • Collaborative Intelligence (multi-agent coordination)
   • Workflow Resilience (fault-tolerant AI pipelines)
   • Distributed Architecture (scalable AI systems)
these 3 - making sure we have multi-agents, fault-tolerant workflows, and a distributed architecture

2. What's your main use case/problem you want to solve? 
   • Based on your RAG system, it looks like you might be working on compliance or technical documentation - is this correct?
   It is the compliance sentinel.
   The basic componentes are:
   - Chainlit for UI ()
   - Dapr Agent (adaptive-interface-agent) that interact with the Chainlit UI and with other agents
    - Dapr Workflow (workflow-agent) that orchestrates the agents and handles the workflow logic
   - Dapr Pub/Sub for communication between agents
   - Dapr State Management for persisting agent states
   - Dapr Secrets Management for handling sensitive information
    Dapr agent "harvester-insights-agent" deal with the insights and compliance checks 
    an Postgres database for storing the results and insights and company data including the compliance checks


## 🚀 Your Refined Implementation Flow:

1. **User Interaction**: User interacts with the Chainlit UI.
2. **Frontend to Backend Communication**: The Chainlit frontend service invokes the `adaptive-interface-agent` (backend service) via Dapr service invocation.
3. **Event-Driven Workflow**:
   - `adaptive-interface-agent` publishes an event to a Dapr pub/sub topic (e.g., `new-request`).
   - `workflow-agent` subscribes to this topic, initiating the workflow.
4. **Insight Harvesting**:
   - `workflow-agent` publishes a message to another topic (e.g., `harvest-insights`).
   - `harvester-insights-agent` subscribes to this topic, performs its analysis, and interacts with the PostgreSQL database.
5. **Result Aggregation**:
   - `harvester-insights-agent` publishes its results to a `results` topic.
   - `workflow-agent` subscribes to the `results` topic, aggregates the data, and stores the final result in the database.
6. **Notification**:
   - `workflow-agent` publishes a final event (e.g., `request-complete`) to notify the `adaptive-interface-agent`.
7. **UI Update**: The `adaptive-interface-agent` updates the Chainlit UI with the final results.

## 🏆 Why This Architecture Wins All 3 Categories:

### **✅ Collaborative Intelligence**
• **Multi-agent coordination**: 3 specialized agents with clear responsibilities, coordinated via pub/sub.
• **MCP tool sharing**: Sophisticated tool orchestration between agents.
• **Sequential thinking**: Advanced reasoning capabilities.

### **✅ Workflow Resilience** 
• **Dapr Workflow**: Built-in state persistence and error recovery using Redis.
• **Pub/Sub Communication**: Decoupled, resilient communication with retries and dead-letter queues.
• **MCP fault tolerance**: Graceful handling of external service failures.

### **✅ Distributed Architecture**
• **Microservices**: Each agent as an independent service.
• **Dapr building blocks**: State management (Redis), pub/sub, and secrets management.
• **Database integration**: Persistent storage with PostgreSQL.

## 🛠️ Implementation Patterns & Technologies

### **High-Level Architecture**
*   **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**: Core of the system, using Dapr Pub/Sub for asynchronous communication between agents. This promotes loose coupling and scalability.
*   **Microservices**: Each agent is a separate microservice, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling.
*   **Orchestration Layer**: The `workflow-agent` acts as an orchestrator, managing the overall flow of the compliance check process.

### **Dapr and Dapr-Agents**
*   **Dapr Agents**: The foundation of our agent-based system. We will use the `DurableAgent` for agents that require state persistence.

    ```python
    from dapr_agents import DurableAgent

    harvester_agent = DurableAgent(
        name="harvester-insights-agent",
        role="Insight Harvester",
        goal="Extract compliance insights from various sources.",
        state_store_name="agentstatestore",
        tools=[] # To be populated with MCP tools
    )
    ```

*   **Dapr Workflow**: The `workflow-agent` will leverage Dapr Workflow to define and manage the long-running compliance process. This provides built-in support for state management, retries, and error handling.

    ```python
    from dapr_agents.workflow import WorkflowApp, workflow, task
    from dapr.ext.workflow import DaprWorkflowContext

    @workflow(name="compliance_workflow")
    def compliance_workflow(ctx: DaprWorkflowContext, input: dict):
        # 1. Start the harvesting process
        harvest_task = ctx.call_activity(harvest_insights, input=input)
        yield harvest_task

        # 2. Wait for the results
        results = yield harvest_task

        # 3. Store the results
        store_task = ctx.call_activity(store_results, input=results)
        yield store_task

        return "Compliance check complete."

    @task(name="harvest_insights")
    def harvest_insights(ctx: DaprWorkflowContext, input: dict) -> dict:
        # Logic to publish message to harvester-insights-agent
        # and wait for a response
        return {"insights": "..."}

    @task(name="store_results")
    def store_results(ctx: DaprWorkflowContext, input: dict):
        # Logic to store results in PostgreSQL
        pass
    ```

*   **Dapr Pub/Sub**: The communication backbone of our system. We will use Redis as the message broker.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Component
    metadata:
      name: messagebus
    spec:
      type: pubsub.redis
      version: v1
      metadata:
      - name: redisHost
        value: localhost:6379
      - name: redisPassword
        value: ""
    ```

*   **Dapr State Management**: We will use Redis to store the state of our agents and workflows.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Component
    metadata:
      name: agentstatestore
    spec:
      type: state.redis
      version: v1
      metadata:
      - name: redisHost
        value: localhost:6379
      - name: redisPassword
        value: ""
      - name: actorStateStore
        value: "true"
    ```

*   **Dapr Secrets Management**: We will use Dapr to securely manage secrets, such as database credentials.

### **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
*   **MCP for Tool Integration**: We will use MCP to provide a standardized way for our agents to interact with external tools, such as DuckDuckGo and the PostgreSQL database.
*   **MCP Server**: We will implement an MCP server that exposes the necessary tools to our agents.
*   **MCP Client**: Our agents will use the MCP client to discover and execute tools.

    ```python
    from dapr_agents.mcp import MCPClient

    mcp_client = MCPClient()
    await mcp_client.connect_stdio()
    tools = mcp_client.get_all_tools()
    harvester_agent.tools = tools
    ```

> 2. `Dapr agent tools example`
> 3. `MCP server implementation`

### **Database**
*   **PostgreSQL**: Our primary data store for compliance results, insights, and company data.
*   **Event Sourcing**: We will use the event sourcing pattern to store the history of compliance checks. This will provide a full audit trail and allow us to easily replay events.

> 1. `Event Sourcing pattern with Dapr`
> 2. `PostgreSQL integration with Dapr`

> 3. `Chainlit frontend best practices`

### **Development and Deployment**
*   **Docker**: We will use Docker to containerize our services for consistent development and deployment.
*   **Docker Compose**: We will use Docker Compose to manage our local development environment.
*   **Kubernetes**: We will use Kubernetes for production deployment, providing scalability and resilience.

## 🧪 Development and Testing Strategy

This section outlines the step-by-step process for developing and testing the Compliance Sentinel, emphasizing a local-first, Docker-based approach.

### **1. Local Development Environment Setup**
*   **Objective**: Create a consistent and isolated development environment using Docker Compose.
*   **`docker-compose.dev.yml`**: This file will define all the services required for local development:
    *   `redis`: For Dapr state and pub/sub.
    *   `postgres`: For the application database.
    *   `chainlit-frontend`: The Chainlit UI service.
    *   `adaptive-interface-agent`: The backend service for the Chainlit UI.
    *   `workflow-agent`: The workflow orchestrator.
    *   `harvester-insights-agent`: The insight harvesting agent.
    *   `mcp-server`: The MCP tool server.
*   **Dapr Sidecars**: Each service will have a corresponding Dapr sidecar defined in the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file.
